# CJR3-Code
This is a simple WordPress plugin that creates a shortcode for displaying code samples in pages/posts more cleanly.

Usage:
[code]
var something = 1;
var somethingElse = 2;
[/code]

Output:

1 : var something = 1;
2 : var somethingElse = 2;

Notes:
- Line numbers are generated by CSS.
- Modifies the content of shortcode into span elements, where each new line (paragraph, heading, etc.) is a new line of code.

Markup output is:
<div class="cjr3-code">
    <span>var something = 1;</span>
    <span>var somethingElse = 2;</span>
</div>
