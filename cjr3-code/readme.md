# CJR3-Code
This is a simple WordPress plugin that creates a shortcode for displaying code samples in pages/posts more cleanly.

Usage:
[code]
var something = 1;
var somethingElse = 2;
[/code]

Output:

1 : var something = 1;
2 : var somethingElse = 2;

Notes:
- Line numbers are generated by CSS.
- Modifies the content of shortcode into span elements, where each new line (paragraph, heading, etc.) is a new line of code.

Markup output is:
&lt;div class="cjr3-code"&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;var something = 1;*lt;/spangt;
    &lt;span&gt;var somethingElse = 2;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
